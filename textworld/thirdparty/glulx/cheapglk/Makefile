# Unix Makefile for CheapGlk library

# This generates two files. One, of course, is libcheapglk.a -- the library
# itself. The other is Make.cheapglk; this is a snippet of Makefile code
# which locates the cheapglk library.
#
# When you install cheapglk, you must put libcheapglk.a in the lib directory,
# and glk.h, glkstart.h, and Make.cheapglk in the include directory.
#
# The file cgunigen.c was generated by the casemap.py script, but
# that step isn't in the Makefile -- you don't have to re-generate it.
# It's based on Unicode character data, which is not platform-dependent.

# Pick a C compiler.
