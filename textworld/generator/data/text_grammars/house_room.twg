#Container Descriptions

#Rules for Container Descriptions
#Good idea to subdivide these into difficulty levels
#room_desc_(chest): generates all container descriptions
#containerdescription: contains all physical exterior descriptions of containers
#room_desc_(chest)_1_name: describes the container as an adj+noun
#room_dec_(chest)_1_noun: describes the container as a noun
#room_desc_(chest)_content: decides if we append a description of the container's contents depending on if the container is open or closed
#opencontainer:what is appended if the container is open
#room_desc_(chest)_2_adj: adds an adjective and a list of contents (creates doubled adjectives?)
#room_desc_(chest)_2: list of contents without an adjective
