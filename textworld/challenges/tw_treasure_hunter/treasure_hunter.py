Treasure Hunter
===============


In this type of game, the agent spawns in a randomly generated maze and
must find a specific object which is mentioned in the objective displayed when
game starts. This is a text version of the task proposed in [Parisotto2017]_.

        * Level 11 to 20: mode medium, nb. rooms = 10, quest length ranging

          from 3 to 20 as the difficulty increases;

        where the different modes correspond to:

        * Easy: rooms are all empty except where the two objects are
          placed. Also, connections between rooms have no door.
        * Medium: adding closed doors and containers that might need to
          be open in order to find the object.
        * Hard: adding locked doors and containers (necessary keys will in
          the inventory) that might need to be unlocked (and open) in order
          to find the object.

        NB: A game may contain cycles in the map, in which case, there can be
            multiple solutions to solve the game.
