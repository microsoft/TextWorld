# This is a basic sample Unix Frotz configuration file.  It contains some
# a few options the average user is likely to want to change.

# If this is actually $HOME/.frotzrc instead of the systemwide
# configuration file, $HOME/.frotzrc will override.  These options are
# explained in more detail in the Unix Frotz README file and the manpage.
