These programs are intended to excercise the interpreter that it is
functioning according to spec.  As far as I can determine, the programs
are in the public domain or made freely available with no restrictions.

crashme.inf	Self-modifying reproducing Z-code.  Generates random junk
		to see how the interpreter behaves.  A good interpreter
		shouldn't die except on fatal errors.
		Written by Evin Robertson in 1999.

etude/		TerpEtude (etude.z5).  Exercises the Z-machine for proper
		behavior.  Does not test error-handling.
		Written by Andrew Plotkin in 1997

gntests.inf	Assorted tests for checking proper handling of fonts,
		accents, input codes, colors, header, and timed input.
		Conforms to the Z-Spec 0.99 by Graham Nelson.  Something
		of a weaker version of TerpEtude (above).
		Written by Graham Nelson as a collection of sample
		programs and unified by Andrew Plotkin in 1997.

random.inf	Inform Randomization Test v1.0.
		Assorted tests for checking the performance of the
		interpreter's random number generator.
		Written by David Griffith in 2002.

strictz.inf	Tests an interpreter's error-checking by attempting to
		cause all possible non-fatal errors.
